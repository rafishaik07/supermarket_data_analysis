# Unguided analytics project executed with pure imagination

Ever wonder what happens to all that data generated when you shop at a supermarket? I built a data analysis project to explore exactly that!

Project Overview:
I imagined and analyzed a supermarket's operations using three key datasets:

Product catalog with 100+ items and pricing

Current inventory stock levels

Two weeks of detailed transaction data (over 400 transactions!)

What I Discovered:
🔍 Top-Selling Products: Identified which items fly off the shelves fastest
💰 Revenue Analysis: Calculated total sales and highest-value transactions
📦 Inventory Insights: Found products that may need restocking soon
⏰ Peak Shopping Times: Revealed when the store is busiest

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Data cleaning and preparation

Excel formulas and functions

Sales trend analysis

Inventory management insights

Business performance metrics

This project helped me understand how data can drive retail decisions - from optimizing inventory to planning promotions. It's amazing how much insight we can gain from everyday shopping data!
